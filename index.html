    <h1>Parallelizing</h1>
    <p> In recent years, I have noticed many people have no knowledge on how a computer works or what components make up
    a computer. I have also noticed that many of us have been spoiled by recent computational advances in computer architecture and write
    code that works insteading of writing code that works optimally. This is very evident in my current work environment where many people who are
    slightly numbers-oriented have decided to teach themselves data science and programming. While this is a great thing, it is important to
    go beyond code that works and instead, aim for code that works AND is optimized for your computer architecutre.
