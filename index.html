    <h1>Parallelizing</h1>
    <p> In recent years, I have noticed many people have no knowledge on how a computer works or what components make up
    a computer. I have also noticed that many of us have been spoiled by recent computational advances in computer architecture and write
    code that works insteading of writing code that works optimally. This is very evident in my current work environment where many people who are
    slightly numbers-oriented have taught themselves data science and programming. While this is a great thing, it is important to
    go beyond learning to code and learn to write code that is optimized for your computer architecutre.
    <br>
    <br>
    Let's start by explaining all the necessary computer components and how they work: <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU): This is the computer's brain. It can perform calculations and execute instructions
        while it coordinates the activities of all other components. CPUs have clocks that generate regular electrical pulses called clock cycles.
        These pulses control the pace of instruction and execution and they regulate the timing of the CPU's activity. Overclocking is the process
        of running a CPU or GPU (more on this later) at a higher clock speed than its default or manufacturer-specified speed. 
      </li>
    </ol>
